# DistractionGuard
DistractionGuard is an application designed to improve focused attention. When configured, DistractionGuard blocks a user's desktop for a certain number of seconds when switching to certain windows. This delay removes the immediate mental reward that comes from being distracted. Over time, switching to distracting windows becomes less appealing due to the delay of gratification.

## Use

In the example screenshot, when the user switches to windows matching "Discord" or "Google Chrome", the desktop will be locked for 5 seconds.
